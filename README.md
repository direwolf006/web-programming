# Abstract 

Every student in a college or university always have many ideas with great vision , but when it comes to implementation they don't know where to start. And most of the cases they have an idea and it's not from their domain. So basically they need a proper collaboration with similar mindsets and most of the rookies don't whom to approach and even the facalites can't every student's interest in thier fingertips. And to provide a solution I have created this SRM Devunite is a web application that helps student to reach and collaborate other students and even faculties if they are willing to, by posting in the application as a post which contains adequate details on major project . THis website is more secure in terms of authentication since the student or faculties have to login with thier college email ID
